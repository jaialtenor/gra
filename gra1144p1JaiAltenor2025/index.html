<h2>Authentic Haitian Spaghetti</h2>
<p>Haitian spaghetti, or espageti, comes from Haiti, and is a combination of diced tomatoes, green pepper, onion, tomato paste, hot dogs, and, of course, Haitian Epis. It creates an explosion of flavor that may take you by surprise! It&rsquo;s a simple dish full of savory goodness and childhood memories for many Haitians. Haitian Spaghetti is a low-cost family meal that is rarely offered in restaurants but it has become a staple in many Haitian and south Florida homes. </p>
